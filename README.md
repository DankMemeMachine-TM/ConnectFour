# ConnectFour
A basic connect four game. That's it, really.

Currently, the game can only be played in the command line. To start it up, do the following:
  * Download the repository, or clone it (I guess).
  * Open up a terminal in the folder you just downloaded.
  * Make sure you have Python installed.
  * Run the following command:
     $python game.py
  * The game will start from there!
